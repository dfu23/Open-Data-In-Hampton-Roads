Open Data &  GIS
==========================
_A Presentation To The Hampton Roads GIS Users Group_  

##Why?  

* __Organizational Benefits__ - data, in an easy to access and open format, creates a reliable a resource, that in turn improves efficiency between offices.

* __Increased Transperancy In Local Government__ -  free and easy access to data encourages citizens and the general public to engage their government in creative and imaginative ways.

* __The majority of your data is out there (and free)__
  * Bing (Microsoft)
  * Google Maps
  * ArcGIS Online Streets
  * Open Streetmap (Foursquare / MapQuest / Apple (Some) / Wikipedia / Craigslist)
  * Here (Nokia)

##Who Supports Open GIS Data?
__Everyone Except You!!__

1. __US Government__  
In January of 2009, the President released a memo on [_Transparency and Open Government_](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/TransparencyandOpenGovernment) which makes three strong points:
  *  __Government should be transparent:__ "Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing"
  *  __Government should be participatory:__ "Public engagement enhances the Government's effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions"
  *  __Government should be collaborative:__ "Collaboration actively engages Americans in the work of their Government."
2. __State Of Virginia__  
[Commonwealth Data Point](http://datapoint.apa.virginia.gov/) is run by the VA Auditor of Public Accounts and gives public access to Virgina demographic data and detailed state financial figures including 100% of all state spending, including all contract payments.
3. __Other Virginia Cities/Counties__  
City of Richmond provides it's [GIS Data](http://www.richmondgov.com/GIS/) and encourages innovators and innovations that demonstrate a more collaborative and open government to submit there maps to the City.  
City of Charlottesville provides it's [GIS Data](http://www.charlottesville.org/Index.aspx?page=1674) for free.    
4. __Cities Across The Country__  
_City of Philadelphia_ --  [Open Data Philly](http://opendataphilly.org/faq/) ".._seeks to improve access to data about Philadelphia, increase government transparency and accountability, drive and encourage innovative uses of the data, and inform citizens about our region's trends._.."  
_Washington DC_ --  [DC Data Catalog](http://data.octo.dc.gov/) ".._provides citizens with the access to 495 datasets from multiple agencies, a catalyst ensuring agencies operate as more responsive, better performing organizations._.."  
5. __Citizens!__  
People who work with your data want it in easily ingestible formats, so that they may work with it in the tools of their choice.
6. __Commercial Vendors__  
Esri is releasing [ArcGIS For Open Data](https://composer.dc.esri.com/) that will allow users with AGOL Organization accounts to publish there existing and new services as 'Open'. This also includes a tool for creating an open data page for your organization. 

####But, there are _many, many_ other __Open Source__ methods to share your data with the public.

##Case Studies  
* __National Park Service__ - NPS has integrated their traditional GIS implementation of ArcSDE with Open Street Map. Custom versions of the open source iD editor for OSM, allows park employees and the public to contribute to the authoritative parks database.  
* __New York City__ - NYC, through legislation, released it's data to the public. Using a series of [open source scripts](https://github.com/osmlab/changewithin), the GIS department changes made in and around their datasets.  
* __Trimet__ - Portland, Oregon's regional commuter transit provider, uses OSM as the basemap for real time navigation, route planning, and scheduling.  

##Things To Know  
* __License__ - your data can be open and free and licensed! For instance, an [ODC-BY](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/summary/) requires users to credit you as the original source. Open Street Map uses an [ODbl](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/) or 'share-alike' type license.  
* __CSV__ - 'Comma Seperated Values' is the preferred method of sharing tabular data. (Never PDF)
* __GeoJSON__ - is a widely used standard for smaller geographic data sets. (Sometimes KML)
* __Shapefile__ - perhaps the most used / shared georgraphic data format and is (mostly) open!
* __GeoTIFF__ - is open standard for sharing raster data.  

##Tools To Use
* __SIMPLE__ Links On A Web Page!  
* [__GitHub__](www.github.com) The de-facto collaborative environment for many organizations.
* [__Open Street Map__](http://www.openstreetmap.org/about) A great tool/workflow for making your data available in highly used map services around the world.  
  * ArcGIS Editor For Open Street Map - [Free Download From Esri](http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2012/03/08/hello-map-getting-started-with-the-arcgis-editor-for-openstreetmap/)  
  * iD - The [default editor](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) for Open Street Map  
  * Edit Directly Within [MapBox Maps](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/improve-this-map/)
* [__Esri2Open__](https://github.com/project-open-data/esri2open) Part of [Project Open Data](https://github.com/project-open-data) is a free ArcGIS toolbox for exporting GIS data to sharable formats.
