Open Data &  GIS
==========================
Short overview of what Open GIS data means, with helpful hints to make publishing data simple and effective.

_Notes For An Upcoming Presentation To The Hampton Roads GIS Users Group_

##Why?

Need A Real No Shit Reason(s) Why Anyone Would Who Normally Charges For GIS Data Would Open Their Data.
* _The majority of your data is out there (and free) and being edited without you_

##Who Supports Open GIS Data?
__Everyone Except You!!__

1. __US Government__  
In January of 2009, the President released a memo on [_Transparency and Open Government_](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/TransparencyandOpenGovernment) which makes three strong points:
  *  __Government should be transparent:__ "Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing"
  *  __Government should be participatory:__ "Public engagement enhances the Government's effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions"
  *  __Government should be collaborative:__ "Collaboration actively engages Americans in the work of their Government."
2. __State Of Virginia__  
[Commonwealth Data Point](http://datapoint.apa.virginia.gov/) is run by the VA Auditor of Public Accounts and gives public access to Virgina demographic data and detailed state financial figures including 100% of all state spending, including all contract payments.
3. __Other Virginia Cities/Counties__  
City of Richmond provides it's [GIS Data](http://www.richmondgov.com/GIS/) and encourages innovators and innovations that demonstrate a more collaborative and open government to submit there maps to the City.  
City of Charlottesville provides it's [GIS Data](http://www.charlottesville.org/Index.aspx?page=1674) for free.    
4. __Cities Across The Country__  
_City of Philadelphia_ --  [Open Data Philly](http://opendataphilly.org/faq/) ".._seeks to improve access to data about Philadelphia, increase government transparency and accountability, drive and encourage innovative uses of the data, and inform citizens about our region's trends._.."  
_Washington DC_ --  [DC Data Catalog](http://data.octo.dc.gov/) ".._provides citizens with the access to 495 datasets from multiple agencies, a catalyst ensuring agencies operate as more responsive, better performing organizations._.."  
5. __Citizens!__  
People who work with your data want it in easily ingestible formats, so that they may work with it in the tools of their choice.
6. __Commercial Vendors__  
Esri is releasing [ArcGIS For Open Data](https://composer.dc.esri.com/) that will allow users with AGOL Organization accounts to publish there existing and new services as 'Open'. This also includes a tool for creating an open data page for your organization. 

####But, there are _many, many_ other __Open Source__ methods to share your data with the public.

##How (Resources)
* [__GitHub__](www.github.com) The de-facto collaborative environment for many organizations.
* [__Open Street Map__](http://www.openstreetmap.org/about) A great tool/workflow for making your data available in highly used map services around the world.  
* [__Esri2Open__](https://github.com/project-open-data/esri2open) Part of [Project Open Data](https://github.com/project-open-data) is a free ArcGIS toolbox for exporting GIS data to sharable formats.
